# Building the App
from the repo folder in the CLI:

$ npm i

$ npm run build

# Running the App
Access index.html in this folder in Chrome.

Optimally, I would cross-browser test this, but for this purpose it would be too time-consuming.

# Using the App
In order to log in to the application, you'll need a Github token. This is where to find [instructions for creating a token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).
